Quick Quiz allows you to load questions in a json format and then answer those questions in the form of a Quiz.

The format is the following:

"Question": 
            {
                "question": "What is 1+1?",
                "answerA": "3",
                "answerB": "2",
                "answerC": "4",
                "answerD": "5",
                "correctAnswer": "2"
             }
